## 💻 Latest Projects
🤖 <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/ai-projects/">AI projects</a>, this is where I post my most recent experimentations with AI frameworks, mainly RAG, Agents, and LLMs
* <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/ai-projects/tree/main/ai-analyst-agent">AI Analyst Agent web app</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/ai-experiments/tree/main/chat-with-your-pdf-ai">Chat with your PDF web app</a>

🛍️ <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/fashion-recommender-cv">Fashion Recommender System</a>, a system that detects fashion objects and learns image representations through Neural Networks. It also utilizes ANN similarity search index to retrieve and rank these image representations.
* Models used: YOLOv5, Convolutional Autoencoder
* Vector Store: FAISS Flat Index
* <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/yolo-object-detection-fashion">Object Detection Model Repo</a>, the object detection model was used to detect fashion objects and obtain bounding box coordinates
* <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/visual-search-with-image-embedding">Embedding Model Repo</a>, the model then obtain a 512-dimensional embedding of each detected fashion objects with an embedding model, and utilized an ANN algorithm to find the top-k similar images based on their vector embeddings

  
📑  <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main">Deep Learning Notebooks</a>
* It currently contains my notebooks related to my experiments with different models and algorithms while working on the fashion recommender project above.
* Image Classification with CNN (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/multiclass-fashion-image-classification">multiclass classification</a>)
* Image Segmentation with UNET and a pretrained ResNet backbone (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/main/multilabel_image_segmentation/unet-segmentation-1.ipynb">multilabel classification</a>)
* Feature Extraction with pre-trained ResNet18 architecture (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/fashion-recommender-v1">fashion-recommender-v1</a>)
* ANN Similarity Search Index comparisons (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/fashion-recommender-v1">fashion-recommender-v1</a>)
