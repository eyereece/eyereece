<h4 align="center">AI | ML | DL</h4>

🔭 I write about everything I've learned related to AI, ML, and DL on my blog <a href="https://www.joankusuma.com">here</a>

🔭 I'm currently working on: <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/fashion-recommender-v1">Fashion Recommender System</a>, a system that learns image representations through Neural Networks and utilize ANN similarity search index to retrieve and rank these image representations.

💻 I post my Practice Deep Learning Notebooks here: <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main">Deep Learning Notebooks</a>, it currently contains a CNN Classification and an Image Segmentation with ResNet notebooks.

<br>My past projects:</br>
<br>📺 <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/movie-recommenders-with-tensorflow">Movie Recommender System </a>, built a two tower model using TensorFlow and Netflix Dataset</br>
<br>🐉 <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/cs50p-python-project">Mini Adventure Game</a>, my first mini project with Python</br>
<br>📊 <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/google-data-analytics-capstone-1">An Analysis of Bike Services Data with R</a></br>
<br>💻 <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/coursera-sql-for-data-science">An analysis of Yelp Reviews with SQL</a></br>
