## 💻 Current Projects
🛍️ <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/fashion-recommender-cv">Fashion Recommender System</a>, a system that detects fashion objects and learns image representations through Neural Networks. It also utilizes ANN similarity search index to retrieve and rank these image representations. <b><i>in progress </i></b>
* Models used: YOLOv5, Convolutional Autoencoder
* ANN index: FAISS Flat Index
  
📑  <a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main">Deep Learning Notebooks</a>
* It currently contains my notebooks related to my experiments with different models and algorithms while working on the project above.
* Image Classification with CNN (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/multiclass-fashion-image-classification">multiclass classification</a>)
* Image Segmentation with UNET and a pretrained ResNet backbone (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/main/multilabel_image_segmentation/unet-segmentation-1.ipynb">multilabel classification</a>)
* Feature Extraction with pre-trained ResNet18 architecture (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/fashion-recommender-v1">fashion-recommender-v1</a>)
* ANN Similarity Search Index comparisons (<a href="https://github.com/eyereece/deep-learning-notebooks/tree/main/fashion-recommender-v1">fashion-recommender-v1</a>)
